# From the sh(1) man page of FreeBSD:
# Exit immediately if any untested command fails. in non-interactive
# mode.  The exit status of a command is considered to be explicitly
# tested if the command is part of the list used to control an if,
# elif, while, or until; if the command is the left hand operand of
# an “&&” or “||” operator; or if the command is a pipeline preceded
# by the ! operator.  If a shell function is executed and its exit
# status is explicitly tested, all commands of the function are con‐
# sidered to be tested as well.
set -e

# Return status is that of the last command to fail in a
# piped command, or a zero if they all succeed.
set -o pipefail

# There is no need to install the prereqs, as this was already
# just done via the dependencies override section of circle.yml.
export NO_PREREQ_INSTALL='true'
